/*
 * This file contains AMS configuration-dependent macros used to
 * provide proper javacall/javanotify calling convention suitable
 * for this particular configuration.
 *
 * Macros expansion depends on the Javacall build options defining
 * which AMS components will be implemented on the Java side and
 * which - on the Platform's side.
 *
 * For example, if the installer is located on the Platform's side and
 * the Application Manager - on the Java side, the declaration of
 * "install a midlet suite" function that is exported by the Installer and
 * is called by the Application Manager will be:
 *
 * javacall_result JCDECL_APPMGR_INST(install_suite)(...);
 *
 * and it will be expanded into:
 *
 * javacall_result javacall_ams_install_suite(...);
 *
 * For the configuration where the Installer is located on the Platform's
 * side and the Application Manager - on the Java side, this definition will
 * be expanded as:
 *
 * javacall_result javanotify_ams_install_suite(...);
 *
