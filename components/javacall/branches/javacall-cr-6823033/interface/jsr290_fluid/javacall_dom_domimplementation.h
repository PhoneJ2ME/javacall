 * OR test if the DOM implementation implements a specific feature.
 * 
 * @param handle Pointer to the object representing this domimplementation.
 * @param invocation_id Invocation identifier which MUST be used in the 
 *                  corresponding javanotify function.
 * @param context The context saved during asynchronous operation.
 * @param feature The name of the feature to test (case-insensitive). The 
 *   values used by DOM features are defined throughout the DOM Level 2 
 *   specifications and listed in the  section. The name must be an XML 
 *   name. To avoid possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring 
 *   to features defined outside the DOM specification should be made 
 *   unique by reversing the name of the Internet domain name of the 
 *   person (or the organization that the person belongs to) who defines 
 *   the feature, component by component, and using this as a prefix. 
 *   For instance, the W3C SVG Working Group defines the feature 
 *   "org.w3c.dom.svg".
 * @param version This is the version number of the feature to test. In 
 *   Level 2, the string can be either "2.0" or "1.0". If the version is 
 *   not specified (parameter is either NULL or the empty string, as per 
 *   http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Conformance), 
 *   supporting any version of the feature causes the 
 *   method to return <code>true</code>.
 * @param ret_value <code>true</code> if the feature is implemented in the 
 *   specified version, <code>false</code> otherwise.
 * 
 * @return JAVACALL_OK if all done successfuly,
 *         JAVACALL_FAIL if error in native code occured
 *         JAVACALL_OUT_OF_MEMORY if function fails to allocate memory for the 
 *             context,
 *         JAVACALL_WOULD_BLOCK caller must call the 
 *             javacall_dom_domimplementation_has_feature_finish function to complete the 
 *             operation,
